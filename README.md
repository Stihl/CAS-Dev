# CAS-Dev
Cheap server

# AIM
The goal of this is to create a cheap build for folks to use for a dev box and a place to run VMs/Containers.

# HW Targets
I will need to do more research on E cores and find out what they actually are capable of but for now im basing this on the typical architecture of just big core with more threads.
8 Cores 16 threads
Ideally the most cores for the least money but I think this is the best starting point.

32GB RAM
I think that 16GB is becoming the 8GB of 7 years ago in gaming. But for most tasks outside of gaming its fine. However, I want to create a system with 2GB per core as to create a linode like scenario with more ideal conditions for the owner and this way a VM can take up more memory without robbing other cores of potential memory so they can be used for smaller tasks like a personal web server, email, etc.

GPU:
basically you just need a display adapter, true you could go with a G series when considering AMD and most intels seem to have an IGPU but if you consider a GPU for compute like AI its really ideal to have a card in the system.
Right now this is a non-gpu system but as im keeping ryzen on the table there may need to be a display card.

PSU:
This will be dependent on if you intend on using a GPU or not. I think something 650 and up should be fine. Im sure there are cheap PSUs with more power than that but I haven't figured out the power budget yet

Motherboard:
To be continued.
